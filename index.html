              <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
                <p>   Though as a financial advisor by trade, and educated with a degree in economics, I can't help but look around me and see 
                the world of software development all around. As an avid video gamer, software development has always piqued my interest
                as a challenging yet very rewarding field. I grew up in Eugene, Oregon and moved to Seattle, WA in August 2020 with our
                our cat Mack and pup Alfie. I now find myself surrounded by some of the major players in the tech world and can't wait to 
                dive in head first and challenge myself to learn as much as I can about the craft.
